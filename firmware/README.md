# Firmware

You can clone my fork of Vial (https://get.vial.today) to view the firmware source:

https://github.com/dcpedit/vial-qmk-dev/tree/vial/keyboards/dcpedit/dissatisfaction30

Or just use the pre-built firmware `dcpedit_dissatisfaction30_vial.hex` and simply flash it with QMK Toolbox.  Then use the Vial software to remap your keys.
